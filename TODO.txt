o Rewrite transform API
	* Current transforms api is both ugly and unspecified, e.g. what should happen if you have simultanous tweens o nthe same layer?
	
o Factor out gpu specific stuff
	* We want to have a cpu fallback.
	
o Replace AMCP with new OSC based implemention (throw out protocol project)
	* All code in the protocol project is non-refactored legacy code.
	 
o Merge in monitor/OSC client project.
